# Jabber PRT Processor

PRT decryption and rename tool. 
This tool will take collected PRTs, decrypt them (if needed), get user's login and rename original PRT.


## Getting Started

Need to pull the repo.
You need to put the 'prt_processor.py' to the directory with collected PRTs, sub-directory 'processed' and 
'decrypted' should be created. Decryption key should be named 'private_key.pem' and located within the same directory.
